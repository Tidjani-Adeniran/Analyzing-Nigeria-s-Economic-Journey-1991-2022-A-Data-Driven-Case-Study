# 📊 Nigeria Macroeconomic Analysis (1991–2022)

This project presents a comprehensive case study on **Nigeria’s macroeconomic trends** from **1991 to 2022**, using **Excel-based statistical methods** to evaluate growth performance, labor dynamics, inflation patterns, and productivity indicators. It showcases how quantitative research and data modeling can uncover critical insights into a country’s economic trajectory.

## 📋 Project Overview

This study involved collecting and analyzing real-world data from reputable sources such as the **World Bank**, **IMF**, **Central Bank of Nigeria**, and national statistical agencies. Using Microsoft Excel's Data Analysis ToolPak, I applied both **descriptive** and **predictive** techniques, including hypothesis testing, outlier removal, correlation analysis, and linear/multiple regression modeling.
